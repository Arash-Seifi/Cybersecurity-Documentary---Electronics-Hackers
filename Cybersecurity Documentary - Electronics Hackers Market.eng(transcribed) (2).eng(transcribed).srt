00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,460
.از ما عقب هستید زمانیکه تکنولوژی در میان باشد
behind us when you have technology that

45
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,530
 - و این تنها یک حقیقت است. الگویی که در
just affect the model that has been

46
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,320
 - شینگن توسعه یافته است در واقع می‌تواند
developed issue John can actually be

47
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,289
 - خیلی ترسناک باشد برای الگوهایی که
quite frightening for models that had

48
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:01,450
 - قبلا تثبیت شده‌اند و در نواحی دیگری
already been established and very

49
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,560
.از دنیا موفق بوده‌اند
successful in other

50
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,009
 - من فکر می‌کنم که
the words I do think that the core

51
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:10,639
،هسته‌ی عقیده به اشتراک گذاشتن آیپی
tenants of sharing IP that they have is

52
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,709
.این است که آنها بسیار فعالند. این یک تغییر فرهنگی است
extremely enabled it's a cultural change

53
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:15,170
یک مدتی طول می‌کشد، اما آینده 
it would take a while but the future is

54
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:29,330
ممکن است. این "سیلیکون ولی" نیست که
possible it's not that Silicon Valley

55
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,920
-از تکنولوژی جدا شده است، آنها بسیار
got divorced from technology they're

56
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,989
-به تکنولوژی علاقه مندند. آنها فقط
very much about technology they're just

57
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:35,209
-به بالا رفتن از بلندی‌ها ادامه دادند و نکته کلیدی که
kept moving up the stack in the key

58
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:38,870
،منجر به این شد از نظر من
thing that drove that in my opinion was

59
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,900
 قانون موریس" بود. قانون موریس از"
Moore's law Moore's law is named after

60
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,940
گوردون مور" نام‌گذاری شده است که یکی از موسسان"
Gordon Moore who was one of the founders

61
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,819
-اینتل" بود و حول و حوش 1960 او با یک"
of Intel and in like 1960s he came out

62
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:50,180
-کاغذ ظاهر شد. او پیش‌بینی کرد که
with a paper he predicted that every two

63
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,459
،گمان می‌کنم هر دو سال
years I believe it was the number of

64
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:54,860
-تعداد اجزایی که می‌توانند در یک تکه سیلیکون
components to get fit and the same piece

65
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:59,299
.با اندازه‌ مشابه جا گیرد، دو برابر می‌شود
of silicon would double and so in one

66
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:01,580
بنابراین در طی یک سال، شما می‌توانید 10 ترانزیستور را 
year you could fit ten transistors in

67
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,980
.در آن جا دهید، در طی دو سال برای مثال می‌توانید 20 تا را جا دهید
here to use they're gonna be like 20

68
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,440
-سپس 40 تا و با گذشت یک دهه
then 40 a decade on you're talking about

69
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,820
 .صحبت از میلیون‌ها و میلیارد‌هاست
like millions and then billions imagine

70
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,769
-تصور کنید شما یک پرینتر دارید و دارید
you have a printer and your printing

71
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:16,220
صفحات را پرینت می‌گیرید، شما می‌خواهید بهینه‌تر باشید
pages and you want to be more efficient

72
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,470
خب شما از فونت با اندازه 12 به -
well you go from a 12-point font to a

73
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,720
فونت با اندازه 6.5 می‌روید.  دوبرابر کاراکترهایی که
6.5 getting twice as many characters in

74
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,549
در یک صفحه هست، شما دارید دو برابر
one page and you're getting twice as

75
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:24,230
.اطلاعات را از پرینترتان دریافت می‌کنید، همه دریک مرتبه
much information on your printer all in

76
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,019
این عینا همه‌ی آن چیزیست که 
one go and that's literally all Moore's

77
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:28,819
قانون موریس بوده است. همان کاهش دادن سایز فونت
law has been is reducing the font size

78
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:32,930
مدارها. در دهه‌های 70 و 80
of circuits in the 70s and 80s there are

79
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,639
-بسیاری از تحقیقات شکست خورده وجود داشته که تلاش کردند
many failed research attempts to build

80
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:37,100
.تا کامپیوترهای موازی بسازند
parallel computers by computers that

81
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,019
"کامپیوترهایی  همانند "کری ماشین‌ها
were like you know the Cray machines and

82
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:41,329
-و ماشین‌های متفکر، 60هزار 
the Thinking Machines sixty thousand

83
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:43,790
پردازنده، مقیاس های بزرگ و چیزی که شما-
processors and scale up and what you

84
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,489
-فهمیدید این بود که اگر شما بیشتر از
found was that if you spent more than

85
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:48,170
-دو سال فرصت تحقیقات را بگذرانید تا تلاش کنید و
two years of research time to try and

86
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,910
،کارایی کامپیوترتان را دوبرابر کنید
double the performance your computer it

87
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,400
-این بسیار ارزان‌تر از آن بود که یک‌جا بنشینید
was by far cheaper just to sit back and

88
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,400
-و منتظر بمانید تا افرادی از اینتل تنها قانون موریس
wait and let guys like Intel just move

89
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,870
-را پیش رو بگذارند و سریعترین پردازنده
Moore's law ahead and buy the next

90
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,120
-بعدی را بخرند و چیزی که شما فهمیدید
fastest processor and so what you found

91
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,850
این بود که در واقع پی سخت‌افزار بودن
was that actually being in hardware

92
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,020
سودآور نیست و
wasn't profitable

93
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,050
-بنابراین چیزی که واقعا در آن زمان فروش محصولات را برگرداند
and so what really sold products back in

94
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:09,020
.امکانات بودند
the day was features well one of the

95
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,550
خب یکی از چیز‌هایی که شما می‌توانید با ویندوز 98 انجام بدهید مشابه چیزی است که
things you can do with Windows 98 it's

96
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,740
-در وب است، شما می‌توانید در هارد
similar to the web you can navigate on

97
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,390
درایوتان با استفاده از دکمه‌های
your hard drive using the backwards and

98
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,040
-عقب و جلو بگردید همانطور که می‌توان
forwards buttons just like we would on

99
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,630
.در وب اینکار را می‌کنیم
the web the first generation of Windows

100
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,399
that would come out and a new generation

101
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,860
would be so slow it'd be completely

102
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,930
unusable and then two years later I go

103
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,370
it's actually kind of okay and then four

104
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,660
years later it's like zipping along it's

105
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,280
not because Microsoft made it faster the

106
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,150
computers got faster for free and so

107
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,310
people are able to now not have to worry

108
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,680
about writing detailed stuff in C code

109
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,300
they could use high-level languages

110
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,730
they're able to use like web pages and

111
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,310
in JavaScript comes along and with all

112
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,380
of that sort of fervor going on and

113
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,990
people chasing that innovation there was

114
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,660
no value in soldering parts it really

115
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,780
wasn't in 1983 worldwide sales of

116
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,690
personal computers increased 76 percent

117
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,900
but last year the increase was only 19%

118
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,690
and this year analysts predicted sales

119
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:06,380
growth will flow to about 4% losses

120
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,150
among the two largest home computer

121
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,550
makers through June of this year

122
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,580
surpassed 600 million dollars in that

123
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,920
building of stuff had to go to an

124
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,110
economy where people were paid a lot

125
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,870
less and what you see is now that

126
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,670
Silicon Valley whole tech ecosystem is

127
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,610
served like driven as far as the road

128
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,470
goes and now Moore's law sort of end is

129
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,660
ending or ended and the car is still

130
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,330
kind of gliding off the cliff right but

131
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,160
there's no more road underneath it in

132
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,350
there like huh like computers just

133
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,880
aren't getting that much faster anymore

134
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,280
and so now you're seeing people going

135
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,920
through a phase of optimization which is

136
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,380
great but at the same time people are

137
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,970
like ok well how do we differentiate my

138
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,190
product right like optimization sucks

139
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,990
it's not a great business model is now

140
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,180
we have super computers in our pocket

141
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,950
now the question is what do we do with

142
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,140
it right and what does that thing in my

143
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,960
pocket or not I already do and so people

144
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,920
are realizing there's niche markets

145
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,320
hardware we need to have a small

146
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,850
accessory you're gonna have like my

147
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,380
Fitbit all these little things my little

148
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,840
digital locks my smartphone's my sensor

149
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,000
networks the IOT sort of stuff coming up

150
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,820
and they say great we need to figure out

151
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,080
how to build this and now they're coming

152
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,330
back to this ecosystem I mean oh you

153
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,220
guys know how to solder we forgot about

154
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:20,850
that

155
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,710
that's really good can you help us build

156
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:46,080
these things what you always say when I

157
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,420
was 18 the first time I go to the US I

158
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,560
use a trash can and I got wood vacuum

159
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,720
cleaner till the very first day of our

160
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,510
robot well you want a robot that's just

161
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,880
like you are slightly better so you

162
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,800
always feel challenged I dropped out

163
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,750
from the university after first year of

164
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,210
college decided to go for this path and

165
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,600
its really nice to be in hacks because

166
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,430
hexes are the best educator and help you

167
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,790
girl

168
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,500
hexxus a hardware accelerator the

169
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,479
world's first hardware accelerator we

170
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,160
take teams that come in with a proven

171
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,840
technology and a prototype and help them

172
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,669
to get ready for market launch we

173
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:26,520
provide 100 thousand US dollars we help

174
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,860
them with electrical engineering design

175
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,720
for manufacture industrial design

176
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,060
mechanical engineering their market

177
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,860
strategy how they're going to launch and

178
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,690
for that we take nine percent equity and

179
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,520
in the startups

180
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,729
I'm Thomas co-founder of Provenza and

181
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:44,280
add Herman so we make a big robot we use

182
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,800
a kind of special joystick it's usually

183
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,599
used in surgery these things

184
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,180
it's a force-feedback joystick the the

185
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,680
market that we targeted the one of

186
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,110
nuclear decommissioning and what you can

187
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,690
see here is a small version of a robot

188
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:01,380
and now our hacks we are building the

189
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,840
very big version so you can compare the

190
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,909
wheel size that will be something quite

191
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:09,090
huge the bigger version of the robot we

192
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,340
transport a robotic arm to automate some

193
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,900
of the part of the the commissioning

194
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,169
work engines as as everybody now knows

195
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:17,789
the hardware capital of the world right

196
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,860
so this has been our home ever since the

197
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,259
starts the reason we can come here and

198
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,150
take the teams here is because of the

199
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,340
ecosystem around which helps them to

200
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,469
build products really fast and from

201
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:31,530
initial concept all the way up to final

202
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,049
product release into the market Noah is

203
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:36,089
a headphone company we're making the

204
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:38,250
world's first tunable headphones they

205
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,140
work out how you hear and provide the

206
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,690
perfect music for you so I can show you

207
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,020
here the hearing profiles of my

208
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,200
colleague Luke and my hearing profile

209
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,510
what you can see is that there is this

210
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,370
difference at certain frequencies

211
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,680
between the way that Luke is sensitive

212
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,620
to that particular note or sound the way

213
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,720
that I'm sensitive to it what our

214
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,839
headphones do is sonically mold the

215
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,050
sound and make sure that what we hear is

216
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,720
not too bassy it's not too trebly it

217
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,480
sounds balanced it sounds even and it

218
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,940
sounds the way that it was recorded

219
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,560
anybody who's going through a certain

220
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,269
development

221
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:18,679
they're better off doing it here because

222
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:20,809
they can get things made so much quicker

223
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:22,699
and so much cheaper I mean you know you

224
00:09:22,699 --> 00:09:24,230
try doing something like that in the UK

225
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,569
and take you around a month typically to

226
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:28,160
make something which is specialists from

227
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,660
an engineering firm here you can do in a

228
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,519
couple of days let's say we completely

229
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,269
design a new robot we can get it out

230
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:37,399
pretty much in a week even if there's

231
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:39,079
ten parts we can send it out or we can

232
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,850
do it ourselves so you get ten sweetie

233
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,379
printers a print at the same time and

234
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:44,480
you get all the parts put it together in

235
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,350
this fire

236
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,569
I never seen any parallel thing like

237
00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:49,670
that when we were in States for for some

238
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,319
of the Senate ports we can order in the

239
00:09:51,319 --> 00:09:52,999
morning and then we get it in the

240
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:56,540
afternoon or the day after we can get

241
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,139
manufactured parts and in a few days in

242
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:02,269
Switzerland we were planning to do this

243
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:06,079
robot in nine months and here we have

244
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,720
the opportunity to make it in in three

245
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,529
months so it's really a race if you look

246
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,360
back through the years I obviously

247
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,629
shinjang became a manufacturing hub very

248
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:20,269
very quickly and not that long ago was

249
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:23,170
literally rice paddies

250
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:29,459
academic wise and in popular media it's

251
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:32,339
usually summarizing one sentence which

252
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:34,709
is that shinjin was a small sleeping

253
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:37,019
fishing village and then because it was

254
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,720
designated as a special economic zone it

255
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,999
became a metropolis overnight that

256
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:44,309
singular sentence is what I'm trying to

257
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:48,809
demystify through my work today exactly

258
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:50,730
how many people lives in Shenzhen is a

259
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,389
mystery the number ten million is used

260
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:56,610
more as a reference so from three

261
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,249
hundred thousand to ten million and this

262
00:10:59,249 --> 00:11:02,189
population grows no cities in the

263
00:11:02,189 --> 00:11:05,370

that was able to do this prior to 1980s

265
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,480
China was in a very poor economic state

266
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,100
there was a stagnation of Industry there

267
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,319
was a plant economy no one was allowed

268
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:25,019

288

was simply what can the country do to

generate jobs to generate economy to

about engine is

326
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,300
even the planners themselves would tell

327
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,540
you that the city evolved in a way much

328
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,210
bigger and faster than they would have

329
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,730
predicted I think it's it's overly

330
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,640
generous thing that shinden was nothing

331
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,440
and then with this set up special

332
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,540
economic zone suddenly it became a city

333
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,820
it didn't there is something else that's

00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,730
innovation that is happening right here

340
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,310
in China we're investing with you the

341
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,350
developer community we have been

342
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,360
investing in open source solutions

343
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,860
because we know that when there are

344
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,110
standards and when there are open source

345
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,450
offerings that the pace of technology

346
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,640
innovation and the pace of technology

347
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:34,560
adoption accelerates I think for the

348
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,050
past hundred years the Industrial

349
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:40,160
Revolution put us into more cages

350
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,840
consumerism has cubed a lot of

351
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,740
creativity but for the post-industrial

352
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,570
generation they should have more freedom

353
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:52,680
to create to explore to invent I things

354
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,180
to make a movement about bringing air

355
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,490
back so we're here with the MakerBot

356
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,610
cupcake C&C which is a 3d printer you

357
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,350
can build things like Thom Yorke's head

358
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,390
because he actually open sourced the

359
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,970
data that was filmed for a video of his

360
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,830
now what's also interesting about this

361
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,570
whole scenario is that there's a whole

362
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,850
thriving community of users who are

363
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,560
taking these to build all kinds of

364
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,240
different objects they're sharing the

365
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,220
objects online and additionally they're

366
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,370
sharing information on how to build and

367
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,770
upon the design everything is completely

368
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,990
open sourced the software's open-source

369
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,150
the hardware is open-source I just can't

370
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,650
wait to see what people come up with I

371
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,700
think the recent emerging of the maker

372
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,430
movement pretty much started around 2003

373
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,760
2004 in the US laser cutting and 3d

374
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,490
printing is helping people to be able to

375
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,410
build stuff and as you beautiful fun

376
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:49,640
rather than just having business workers

377
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,810
right around that x guy named Dale

378
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,910
Dougherty he was thinking about starting

379
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,730
a publication called make before make

380
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,740
came out the only word we had was a

381
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,690
hacker right and I think he didn't want

382
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,550
to call them are using hack because it

383
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,410
had a really negative connotation at the

384
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,780
time and make was sort of the thing you

385
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,579
would type to compile a program so it

386
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,890
would resonate well with programmers and

387
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,170
maker was like serve the demonym of

388
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,730
people who would read the magazine

389
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,579
that's sort of coined the turn maker I

390
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,709
think in clean up publication he sort of

391
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:21,780
solidified the movement in the Maker

392
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,118
Faire created that phenomenon

393
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:27,700
[Music]

394
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,919
in China in beginning new partners bar

395
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:33,409
makers do bar cared about makeup on

396
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:34,850
because we're gonna make fierce in

397
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:39,260
Europe in the area where circulars so

398
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,610
instead of waiting for someone to do

399
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:45,200
that we say why don't we do it when they

400
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,340
told me they were gonna bring the first

401
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,440
maker fair here I was like how do you

402
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,779
have a maker fair in a area where people

403
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:53,299
don't make for a recreational thing they

404
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:55,309
do it for a job right you know cuz

405
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:57,649
making in the West is something that

406
00:17:57,649 --> 00:18:00,110
you're using to remind people who are in

407
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,880
service economies that there's a thing

408
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,529
called manufacturing right when you have

409
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:05,360
a manufacturing economy you want to

410
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,559
remind them of this manufacturing that

411
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,690
seems weird and what I realized is that

412
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,970
actually China's middle classes aside

413
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,889
the entire United States population so

414
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:15,529
even if a small section Chinese people

415
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:17,480
had risen to the upper middle class it's

416
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,679
big enough to create a movement in China

417
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:20,210
itself compared to the United States

418
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,230
scale making

419
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,059
we don't know it's going to be

420
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:29,330
successful or not the first year we have

421
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:34,039
over 60 makers and NASA we have over 200

422
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:37,489
makers it's a huge number some

423
00:18:37,489 --> 00:18:39,350
interesting phenomena are also emerging

424
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,869
out of this in the past years what's

425
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:43,609
happening is the open source hardware

426
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:46,850
movement traditionally the second

427
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,309
poorest coast and proprietary you need

428
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:51,350
to have a contract and non-disclosure

429
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:54,830
and a huge sum of prepayment in order to

430
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,289
get access but with open source how

431
00:18:57,289 --> 00:18:59,149
where everybody can access to that

432
00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:01,340
information and everybody can modify

433
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,299
that to suit any people here they create

434
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:07,669
a circuit board and the just under

435
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:10,759
expectation it is going to be open it's

436
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:13,549
going to be copy and evolved by someone

437
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:15,409
else there's no one running around in

438
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:17,029
Shenzhen say okay well I should be

439
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:19,009
creative for creating this if someone

440
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:21,739
else can make this get someone else to

441
00:19:21,739 --> 00:19:22,340
use it

442
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,889
marietta better not having the Eagle

443
00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:27,169
attached to our creations and understand

444
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:30,460
how actually open-source system works

445
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,229
the maker movement is at that junctures

446
00:19:33,229 --> 00:19:35,239
I'm getting a little sick of hearing

447
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:37,849
about the same people on TV over and

448
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:40,220
over and over again so I decided to do

449
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,859
something about it this Arduino project

450
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:44,479
which I called the enough already will

451
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:46,779
mute the TV anytime any of these

452
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:49,249
overexposed personalities is mentioned

453
00:19:49,249 --> 00:19:52,039
to mute the TV I'm gonna use an IR LED

454
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:54,679
now any time a keyword is mentioned the

455
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:56,899
TV will mute for 30 seconds our

456
00:19:56,899 --> 00:19:58,399
producers caught up with Kim Kardashian

457
00:19:58,399 --> 00:20:02,119
earlier today it should do a pretty good

458
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,889
job of protecting our ears from having

459
00:20:03,889 --> 00:20:05,659
to hear about the details of Kim

460
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:07,580
Kardashian's wedding

461
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,190
arduino is becoming the trigger point

462
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,590
because it has too many minions of

463
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:17,929
makers are using that arm for their

464
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:22,419
people have talkies and diseases and

465
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,830
stable if we come to shenzhen like 10

466
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,110
years ago 20 years ago it will be very

467
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,360
difficult for a maker to tap into

468
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,850
resources but now you have so many

469
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,100
resources it's in the middle of our

470
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,409
reforming so the big company especially

471
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:46,129
the silicon providers like Intel like a

472
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:49,609
male like TI's you look at that oh we

473
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:51,859
have new customers we have a new

474
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:54,529
possibility for new future applications

475
00:20:54,529 --> 00:20:57,619
of where our technologies so they makes

476
00:20:57,619 --> 00:21:00,409
their own controller board like Edison a

477
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:04,759
Curie so they want to tap into the early

478
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:07,070
stage of the development of the

479
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,739
applications now this port is based on

480
00:21:09,739 --> 00:21:11,749
the Intel technology so it's tiny

481
00:21:11,749 --> 00:21:14,389
dual-core computer system it has two

482
00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:17,239
Wi-Fi Bluetooth and it is also it's

483
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:20,179
around a Linux operating system on it I

484
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:22,279
think part of the reason Intel's having

485
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:24,559
to sort of turn that way they know their

486
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,090
road map as well as anyone else does

487
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:28,369
they kind of define Moore's law and they

488
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:30,049
saw the bridge go out and from

489
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:31,460
underneath them before anyone else did

490
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,230
they've managed to drive technology like

491
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,119
this and then the other founders like

492
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,190
TSM see and you see of Austria behind

493
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,359
but now that's slowing down everyone's

494
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:40,239
catching up they're like oh god we're

495
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:42,649
looking for air and trying to find a

496
00:21:42,649 --> 00:21:44,570
place to move and so they've struggled

497
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,299
to keep up with the phenomenon they

498
00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:48,769
created they haven't made headway into

499
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:50,210
mobile and those are the most ubiquitous

500
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,159
computer today they're missing on a huge

501
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,960
market opportunity and so it's the

502
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,159
extent that they're trying to figure out

503
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:58,129
how to adapt their innovation model to

504
00:21:58,129 --> 00:22:00,169
something more flexible and so they

505
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:01,549
really want to make sure the Intel brand

506
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:04,580
is in front of the youth to make sure

507
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,320
that they remember that Intel is

508
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,600
actually like a thing that they want to

509
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,730
design with later on and not just you

510
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,700
know something out of reach

511
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,509
we have tried to introduce it to nine

512
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:19,299
years old this is a little bit difficult

513
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:21,999
but is acceptable you do not need to

514
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:25,059
write any boring code in a smart note

515
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:27,340
you can just drag and drop and the link

516
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,649
them together what they're doing is

517
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:31,600
they're learning how to code on a

518
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,419
computer translate that into hardware

519
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:37,059
and they'll build a project on our laser

520
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:39,820
cutter or a 3d printer for something to

521
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,279
accept a stimulus light motion or sound

522
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,139
and then output some result

523
00:22:44,139 --> 00:22:46,809
last year one kid built a key reminder

524
00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:48,700
for his mom so that when she left the

525
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,859
house a motion sensor would pick up her

526
00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:52,779
movement and say hey don't forget the

527
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:55,629
cue and it's kind of funny to hear that

528
00:22:55,629 --> 00:22:58,450
a eight-year-old will know whether he

529
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,789
wants to be doing mechanical circuits or

530
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:02,889
just a purely software experience

531
00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:05,499
so that's enter level and then would

532
00:23:05,499 --> 00:23:07,659
give them more systematic introduction

533
00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:09,549
to how to build I have the skews off you

534
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:11,859
go you can't use the makerspace to

535
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:13,989
create whatever you want you are genius

536
00:23:13,989 --> 00:23:16,299
you are young inventors I've seen some

537
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:18,340
great examples of open-source hardware

538
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,739
being used to actually make a difference

539
00:23:20,739 --> 00:23:22,600
and create a better world

540
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,179
the difficulty is monetizing that

541
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:27,629
because I do believe that business

542
00:23:27,629 --> 00:23:30,429
solves a lot of the world's problems and

543
00:23:30,429 --> 00:23:32,019
people need to be able to make money if

544
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:33,580
you're providing value to the world

545
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,929
which is making a world a better place

546
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:37,269
then there should be compensation for

547
00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:41,590
that in 2010 I started the first

548
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:44,950
makerspace in China Kosh intogen I can

549
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,409
invite a lot to give a talk about open

550
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:49,629
source our the first question always

551
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:52,090
come up on people's mind is how do you

552
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,859
protect your intellectual property and

553
00:23:53,859 --> 00:23:56,080
how can you make money if you don't

554
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,450
protect your intellectual property I got

555
00:23:58,450 --> 00:23:59,950
that question in Shanghai I got a

556
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,289
question in Beijing I got that question

557
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:05,139
everywhere I go but when I give the same

558
00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:08,320
talking center the reaction I card is so

559
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,539
what's new about this we've been making

560
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:12,440
money on this for 20 years

561
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:25,039
[Music]

562
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,720
geot for insurance shows to each other

563
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,020
UNCG energy Santee Tony Romo hero Arlo

564
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,150
general pop I thought you turned into by

565
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,990
auditors who I said

566
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:39,610
[Music]

567
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:42,070
the reason we're here in much fun pay is

568
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,360
literally because of the Optronics

569
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,100
markets you know it's a fantastic

570
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,370
resource of all different possible

571
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,550
components and different devices which

572
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,830
can kind of be Frankenstein together to

573
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,440
make prototypes both teams it's a source

574
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,390
of inspiration it's a source of

575
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,490
discovery of new products that could

576
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,830
potentially be taken to the west like I

577
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,620
see every month of different invention

578
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,510
down there but nine times out of ten

579
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,620
they're probably not gonna make it to

580
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:12,370
the west but some of them do chicken and

581
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,110
I've got a zombie the twenty more sugar

582
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:17,140
three tickets you young ladies from the

583
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,680
UK online now so she can champion oh she

584
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,450
gonna walk when she saw the even farm

585
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,550
Enda how do don't you wander you

586
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,320
mouthwash I mean I don't need the show

587
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,030
how again zero shows you need a little

588
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,010
how many Dodson had pull it off the pie

589
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,050
you can get a little bit of feel here

590
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:33,820
what's even upstream of what's gonna hit

591
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,830
the tacky United States you see a couple

592
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:38,140
things popping up here they're a little

593
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,300
shop well right oh well pop out no we're

594
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,650
selling these things and heard it before

595
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,300
like the hoverboards we're here a couple

596
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,620
years before they hit the United States

597
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,720
and then you eventually sort of see them

598
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,530
hit the states and other countries Chile

599
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,900
sweet you party on base facility for

600
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,460
surely don't think you got a song here

601
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:54,790
John

602
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,740
sorry Thomas all the time since 2003

603
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:02,440
similar to volatility to show you go see

604
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,340
us and see Santi show liquor logical

605
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,600
Chile's your to Santiago the thing

606
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,590
there's a number of different ways to

607
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:14,350
sort of look at the market for an

608
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,570
engineer you're sort of limited it's

609
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,520
thumbing through catalogs and looking at

610
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,760
pictures and very slowly going through

611
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,080
specification sheets for examples if you

612
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,810
want to put a switch in a product if you

613
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,490
want to know how it feels you want to

614
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,410
kind of know the exact size and the

615
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:31,390
little mountings and the fussy bits and

616
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,220
it can take a long time to find exactly

617
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,650
the right part become here and there

618
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:37,270
like stalls with like hundreds of

619
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,680
different types and you can just reach

620
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,240
in and just touch them and play with

621
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,430
them and can like what stall by stall

622
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,830
and see all the different variety and

623
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,360
it's not there it's not just a showroom

624
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,460
if once you find this which you like you

625
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,400
can be like highlight by

626
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,750
thousand of them and then for very

627
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,040
little price so you can just over the

628
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,750
kind of buy it carry it off and you know

629
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:56,440
go into production

630
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:02,510
you can fix your phone here Kodama

631
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,710
triggers a woman okay I'll call the

632
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,620
daughter

633
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:11,300
okay yeah Lisa Lillien

634
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:18,430
Tydeus variously as yo mama

635
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:26,330
it's got a huge amount of acquired

636
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:29,480
knowledge and skills there's electrical

637
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,180
engineers there who solder up 50 PCBs

638
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:35,330
for you in record time you can go down

639
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,530
there and piece together different

640
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,840
components to make a new mobile phone

641
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,980
there's nowhere else in the world you

642
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,880
can do that

643
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,400
you know you can get like a chipset that

644
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,650
was in a notebook for example you know

645
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,590
less than $15 which can enable computing

646
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:51,440
power in sell a new product that's you

647
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,240
know fantastic resource for some

648
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,750
startups that kind of philosophy is kind

649
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,390
of spread out around China

650
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:03,170
Carmen Sally me and Amador Yugoslavia

651
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:05,210
totally worth friends how much help was

652

the shazier the photometer South Korea

668
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:58,540
even Superman comic I just really love

669
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,760
it love it I this one here Joe Tom allow

670
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,160
it is my interest you at home sure Joe

671
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,960
you're serious it actually talked up the

672
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,160
whole Hollywood that Cody

673
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,140
what is your hula jihad and willing by

674
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,830
the kite uncle Chi to make us appear so

675
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,750
in a Commodore t-shirt if you can just

676
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:18,700
shuffle spiritual either emotion when we

677
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,770
starting to look at the maker coming to

678
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:24,070
send then that's this excitement and how

679
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:26,380
open their system is like nowhere else

680
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,780
you can buy all sort of stuff everything

681
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,630
is available the embody find in the West

682
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,880
there's a binary distinction between the

683
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,160
makers and the Howard startup the maker

684
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,260
you do this for fun you do is for your

685
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,600
passions but when you're starting to

686
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,250
make this into a business you should

687
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,960
forget about sharing you should forget

688
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,510
about all this open stuff and focusing

689
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,610
on the business but in here

690
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,890
that's very little differentiations

691
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:53,830
between I want to make this for fun and

692
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:56,020
I want to make this for profit

693
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,300
there's no binary division of the

694
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,240
mindset of makers versus startup make a

695
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,000
start-up in China it's a continuum

696
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,060
you shouldn't been stopped from making

697
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,950
money out of the thing you love to do

698
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:12,310
and you should not be forced to choose

699
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,350
between open and proprietary just

700
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,330
because you want to become a business

701
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:19,030
why now it's just in the West

702
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:22,390
we haven't seen open source our system

703
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,940
working generating was a logo sure

704
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,890
jealousy so that our total agenda she

705

comiendo went to heaven familia kids

707
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,940
what about you anymore young people now

708
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,800
the second coalition iphone have my own

00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,690
that allowed this year please enjoy the

710
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:43,240
EP eventually campaña de mañana

711
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,800
first you should have the chill on your

712
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,590
top social to tell you more yonder i've

713
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,770
also

714
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:51,410
Laura don't you know that you can either

715
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:54,090
chunk of intelligent way

716
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:57,189
[Music]

717
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:09,140
in the West is an idea that I can have a

718
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,750
company that produces nothing it has a

719
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,700
ton of patents but produces money by

720
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,410
suing everyone for rights those patents

721
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,790
do you even have inventors you have

722
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,710
lawyers making money off of buying

723
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,750
intellectual property and trading it

724
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,730
that's weird right it's kind of weird

725
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:24,290
that you produce nothing but make a lot

726
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:27,200
of money the idea that you can take an

727
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,570
idea in a world that's this big and say

728
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:32,600
exactly one person owns the right to it

729
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,810
globally like Apple has the right to the

730
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,940
phone with rounded rectangles they're

731
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,460
the only people who can produce that

732
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:43,490
really like seriously this is the word

733
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:44,750
we're gonna live in like we just give

734
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,700
people monopolies through the IP system

735
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,190
for 20 years for stupid ideas because

736
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,970
they were first-to-file

737
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:56,150
that made sense back in the day when

738
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,740
there were fewer people less innovators

739
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,500
a less connected world now we have like

740
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,180
this network of people were like we're

741
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,830
empowered to do our things and we can

742
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,530
almost trade our creativity and China's

743
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:09,620
ecosystem it is this network ecosystem

744
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,210
of an idea for an idea like let's let's

745
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:13,460
trade now you realize your place in

746
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,350
ecosystems I need other people around me

747
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,060
you can't be a dick to like all the

748
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,680
other guys around you just because you

749
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,840
have a monopoly on this thing someday

750
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,610
you're going to be on the bottom side of

751
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,020
the chain and you're going to need other

752
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,760
people's help and so you build networks

753
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,190
of collaborations with people by sharing

754
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:32,050
in this open source philosophy

755
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:41,150
oh yeah we have all first copycat let's

756
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,460
say it's a plan so but yeah reverse

757
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:59,360
engineer from the video of the all the

758
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,560
hardware companies that come in here of

759
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,270
course we encourage them to pass on all

760
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,880
of their technology but we don't expect

761
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,220
them to fight anybody who's copying them

762
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,410
we expect them to be moving much faster

763
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:11,600
than anybody who's copying them and

764
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,620
coming up with the next thing the whole

765
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,930
time and building a brand and eventually

766
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,120
those patents may get used when they get

767
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,400
into a patent trade off that's the use

768
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,950
of patents not not not to stop people

769
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,810
copying you the way to stop people

770
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:26,210
copying is to make whatever they're

771
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,620
copying irrelevant because you've come

772
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,570
up with something much better a huge

773
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,250
barrier I think to small companies the

774
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,350
United States is like the patent system

775
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,840
in the copyrights and just like left and

776
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,910
right as legal challenges and you spend

777
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,610
a huge portion of your money on lawyers

778
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,800
and IP filings and all it sort of stuff

779
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,900
it it's a drag it really is if you want

780
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,310
to be making stuff you want to be

781
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,810
actually working with people and sharing

782
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:53,690
ideas openly and getting things going hi

783
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:56,600
I'm Shane I like to do many things

784
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,300
this one's called a solo week you

785
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,910
control speed by indeed this is my laser

786
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:04,840
beam isn't it's called a cover tracks

787
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,190
yeah the whole board story is a very

788
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:09,739
interesting example of somebody in

789
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:11,270
America who came up with the

790
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,879
intellectual property and then spent a

791
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:17,000
long time fighting manufacturers who

792
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,100
were actually creating something which

793
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,889
was similar that's a great example of a

794
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:23,570
case where I would have encouraged

795
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,310
somebody not to start like fighting

796
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:28,159
around IP protection it's better just to

797
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,830
build a brand around a really great

798
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,440
product make sure you've got you know

799
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,770
the leading product in the area this is

800
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,659
really the first time we have a

801
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,090
technology product which become widely

802
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,260
popular which

803
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,000
I'm a cultural icon pack we don't have a

804
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,429
name for it it just emerged more people

805
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:48,980
come in the Bob wait we get the Bobby

806
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,810
tricking eventually you will get to a

807
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:53,869
form which will go viral this is kind of

808
00:34:53,869 --> 00:34:56,149
point to the future of how things could

809
00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:58,359
happen

810
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,330
so in Horsham Bay you still find some

811
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:03,950
cheddar biscuit fakes there are

812
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:07,280
reproductions of established brands I'll

813
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,070
give you an example because this is a a

814
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:13,220
contemporary sort of Shan Zhai Matt

815
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,970
watch running on an Android system the

816
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:19,609
reproductions were really the items that

817
00:35:19,609 --> 00:35:21,770
were sought after by people who could

818
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:26,350
not afford the the real thing

819
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:31,630
my understanding is that the early Shan

820
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,539
Zhai were people who worked for the

821
00:35:34,539 --> 00:35:36,760
bigger corporations here like Nokia

822
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,970
Motorolla Foxconn and they were some

823
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:42,010
very smart engineers who got sick of the

824
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,770
management and I like look I can build a

825
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,450
phone cheaper better faster than these

826
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,859
guys can I understand why I have all

827
00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:50,260
this process I can make it for half the

828
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:53,109
price if we just cut cut the fat and

829
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,000
they would quit talk to their friends

830
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,559
who they knew all this upstream

831
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:59,020
suppliers and they would get the other

832
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,730
parts and they would build you know what

833
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,559
we're effectively you know copycat

834
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:04,510
phones the key innovations are able to

835
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,609
do it much much lower cost just you know

836
00:36:06,609 --> 00:36:08,770
learning how to walk before they could

837
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:11,410
run essentially the most similar things

838
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:14,710
to the ideas of Santa in the West it's

839
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:17,200
the idea of Robin Hood they try to

840
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,930
empower the poor with the latest

841
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:23,170
advancement in technology since I and

842
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:26,319
the maker movement startups yeah Freya

843
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:28,900
like they are very much share the same

844
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:32,260
spirit even the DNI from becoming a they

845
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:38,799
feel powerful when they talk about

846
00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:41,650
people who left the factories incopy the

847
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:44,619
phone well that was kind of like the

848
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,940
open source stuff that was an open

849
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,339
source they just sort of like oh the

850
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:50,260
schematics are in the desk I will

851
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,819
community help myself to them make a

852
00:36:51,819 --> 00:36:54,400
photocopy and then leave the factory

853
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,349
with it right you know was that stealing

854
00:36:56,349 --> 00:36:58,510
or was it open source right in in the

855
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:01,210
West it's called theft right out here

856
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:05,079
it's called sharing so the device is

857
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:09,160
that there's a hall from the market and

858
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,400
you can see it has a number of markings

859
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,529
on it this one was the the higher grade

860
00:37:14,529 --> 00:37:19,119
version it was 70 80 bucks u.s. when you

861
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,220
power it on you see that it's running a

862
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:24,240
a very well skin flavor of Android

863
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,099
iconography is actually pretty good and

864
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:28,960
then the great thing is this one

865
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,910
supports two SIM cards replaceable

866
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:33,390
memory card and a replaceable battery

867
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,920
batteries which is actually a feature

868
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,290
that many local people really want to

869
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,150
have there they're unhappy about a

870
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:42,360
having no memory card slot and B having

871
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,820
not a replaceable battery the companies

872
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,520
were able to access very easily the two

873
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,680
basic components that you need to make a

874
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,750
phone one is the boom ban which is

875
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,000
basically a twin tip circuit boards and

876
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,100
the other one is the Gumo which is

877
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,870
basically the shell so there were

878
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:01,200
companies specialising in making boom

879
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,100
bang and boom all that had slots for

880
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,470
those printed circuit boards that were

881
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:10,560
very easily accessible by the companies

882
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,810
you know people from the West who are

883
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:14,550
used to sort of month-long development

884
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,410
cycles like how do I do this is amazing

885
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,090
like this capability came out of nowhere

886
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:20,220
overnight but actually it's been honed

887
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,890
over like a decade or two out of those

888
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:24,660
roots of people you know coming out of

889
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,310
the big factories and figuring this all

890
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:28,010
out themselves

891
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:30,540
Shandra a sample that is still going on

892
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:33,840
now but it is a very small percentage of

893
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,720
what is produced in the market there is

894
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,000
a very strong emerging middle class in

895
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,690
China that has the purchase power to

896
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:45,570
afford the original items that may be

897
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:48,210
more extensive than being reproductions

898
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:53,070
it is not possible to target new markets

899
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,740
just with imitating the established

900
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,050
brands there is a limit to what can be

901
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:01,170
achieved in that sense once they kind of

902
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,820
got in a position where they could now

903
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,640
build a copy of a phone pretty well they

904
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,530
can now start innovating they'll take

905
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,270
like an Android phone an iPhone and mash

906
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,530
them together and come up with this

907
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:12,900
weird thing that is pretty cool and it's

908
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,480
different in some way you know if you go

909
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,280
in in the market in question but you

910
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,530
will find there many people distributing

911
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:22,410
this type of advertisements for company

912
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:24,930
that are called white brand companies

913
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:27,270
that will make it for you assembling

914
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:29,430
very very different components and that

915
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:31,520
you can add your your own

916
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,800
your name or whatever you want and

917
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,490
distribute it as your own item yeah

918
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:38,690
these are these are all white label

919
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:41,690
ideas it's an empty sample and all these

920
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:44,000
are different empty samples so they can

921
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,990
go ahead and build it for you on the

922
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,510
spot and then order I don't know however

923
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,100
many you want and later you can actually

924
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,720
ask them to go ahead and put your

925
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,800
graphic on the front you know for

926
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,460
example or maybe you know these logos

927
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:59,810
over here in the West kind of philosophy

928
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:00,800
is are we come up with something really

929
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,570
fantastically new that nobody's done

930
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,610
before become the market leader and

931
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,620
we're really successful the Chinese

932
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,240
mentality is slightly different they

933
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,860
look at something that's already on the

934
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,960
market and then they create a much

935
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,730
better version of it much quicker it's

936
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:17,030
not copying its evolution of products

937
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:20,540
which becomes much better than what was

938
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:26,090
out there before we've grabbed another

939
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,280
one in the market there looks like a

940
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,290
SmartWatch but you'll notice that I only

941
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:33,320
has a single button and the graphics are

942
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,180
made for children so this is a phone

943
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:38,330
plus GPS module that you can use to sort

944
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:40,640
of report a kid's location if the kid is

945
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,230
in trouble they can dial their parents

946
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:44,480
you can see it has like SOS call

947
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,480
features I would bet that probably 80 to

948
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,910
90% of the design material in here is

949
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:52,340
borrowed from other vendors who use

950
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,750
these previously and other SmartWatch

951
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:56,090
designs but people are sharing the IEP

952
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:58,040
the guy who probably shared the IEP to

953
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,600
them was someone who could sell them

954
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,090
chips or motherboards of circuit boards

955
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,830
and so there was some factory backing up

956
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,690
that sharing crosses they want people to

957
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:07,700
use these things and that lets these

958
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,310
guys try try try like this what many

959
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:12,080
models of this in fact when we're buying

960
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,330
this as a woman next to us was asking

961
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:15,710
for these and then left on the table we

962
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,300
said this one's too thick let's go find

963
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,280
one that's that's that's thinner than

964
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,960
this one over here they'll probably have

965
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,340
less features or less battery life or

966
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,320
whatever it is but the market here can

967
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,790
build these different variants and

968
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:28,490
service it gives of the phenomenal

969
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:29,260
ecosystem

971
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,420
something is really happening companies

972
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,789
are realizing the importance of having

973
00:41:42,789 --> 00:41:45,730
new ideas and being different so many

974
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:47,260
companies who were involved in the

975
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,839
Shanghai before are now looking at

976
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,730
design they're now looking at how to

977
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,650
develop innovation in their own

978
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:56,529
companies the model that has been

979
00:41:56,529 --> 00:41:59,319
developed in Shenzhen can actually be

980
00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:01,599
quite frightening in other parts of the

981
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,450
world and it's not surprising that many

982
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:07,059
American companies are now looking at

983
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:09,579
models that are developed in China to

984
00:42:09,579 --> 00:42:18,789
see how they can adjust themselves well

all the biggest industry we actually

1021
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:04,759
dominate anywhere between an eight to 12

1022
00:44:04,759 --> 00:44:07,969
percent of the US market audio side but

1023
00:44:07,969 --> 00:44:10,669
what we're doing so different is we we

1024
00:44:10,669 --> 00:44:13,159
have our own these I house we're able to

1025
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:15,049
create some really cool incredible

1026
00:44:15,049 --> 00:44:19,879
product so here's like design house some

1027
00:44:19,879 --> 00:44:21,949
inspiration about what we can do we have

1028
00:44:21,949 --> 00:44:24,949
like some instruments 3d printing rapid

1029
00:44:24,949 --> 00:44:27,859

1030
00:44:27,859 --> 00:44:32,479

1032
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:37,010
in China a lot of factories are very

1033
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:39,710
traditional so this is also very a new

1034
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:43,100
model the CEO he tried to drag this

1035
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,820

1036
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:49,220

people don't realize that there's at

least twenty six percent of the

1049
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:24,020
technology from Silicon Valley actually

1050
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,540
converse in jail so what they do is they

1051
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:29,570
hire kind of like a headhunter so to

1052
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:32,800
speak because there's so much innovation

1053
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,380
we are about minimum of a month to a

1054
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,290
year events when it comes of technology

1055
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:42,650
for example we have made this incredible

1056
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:45,710
bed you can sleep on there and the

1057
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:47,600
moment you wake up in the morning you'll

1058
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,060
give you stats how many tell you roll

1059
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:51,860
over how much Steven how much rest you

1060
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:54,410
and then also can treat your blood

1061

1062
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:57,710
you gotta tell you you have any problems

1063
00:45:57,710 --> 00:45:59,960
we identify and this is technology

1064
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,210
existing range today and we've done this

1065
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:03,200

the kissing people making I don't try

1072
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:18,380
anything we say like 25 percent of

1073
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:21,140
innovation creating engines and are by

1074
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:25,190
by the American say by it go to us and

1075
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:27,830
then they sell it here 100 time more

1076
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:30,140
expensive china feel little bit bored i

1077
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:32,090
think about this business model we made

1078
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:34,430
it here but all the credit is are is for

1079
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:36,700

1080
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:39,319

you from thank him Papa Union he playing

1084
00:46:51,089 --> 00:46:53,430
hey tinkle everybody is looking for the

1085
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,890
Chinese startup made in China

1086
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:58,170
want the proof to show to the world like

1087
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:01,319
look we innovate we have a lot of

1088
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:02,339
opportunity here

1089
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:05,339
I think all focus should be let's create

1090
00:47:05,339 --> 00:47:09,630
a quality product and you can be proud

1091
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:12,660
and say this is made in China so if you

1092
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:15,690
can just focus on that new technology to

1093
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:18,660
focus on a branding and to focus on

1094
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,329
equality and I think with the next five

1095
00:47:21,329 --> 00:47:23,880
year people have different perspective

1096
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,359
of made in China I think that will

1097
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,569
happen

1098
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,860

within 35 years of time its uniqueness

1116
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,860
is fading because those same innovation

1117
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,020
say policy innovation or industry

1118
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,850
innovation now it's everywhere in China

1119
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:32,520
so it doesn't have that edge of being

1120
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,290
the only one or even the first one

1121
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:37,520
anymore it's kind of a catch-22 right it

1122
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,050
recognizes what it has been able to

1123
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:43,200
achieve but it's also inherent like how

1124
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,760
are you gonna make it better

people who come to sunshine get older

and as the experience grows the start to

00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:58,840
develop something near as a

become brands

moment for innovations because I can

attract at least our portion of them to

1150

and small selection process by a small

1193
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,560
group of people who what a venture

1194
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:56,380
capitalist young white males between

1195
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:58,270
twenty to thirty controlling how

1196
00:51:58,270 --> 00:52:00,550
technology orbit about how technology

1197
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:03,160
will be a-prime and how technology will

1198
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,190
be available to the general public that

1199
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:09,550
is the very definition of control

1200
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:12,040
economy they're ready to have like these

1201
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,560
massive settlement fights and epic legal

1202
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,270
battles I call their Supreme Court and

1203
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:17,080
stuff like that

1204
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,300
if everyone were like you know actually

1205
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:21,430
we all do good job let's just work and

1206
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:22,839
try to figure out how to innovate but

1207
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:24,160
it's a matter of getting critical mass

1208
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,710
of people to buy into it without a big

1209
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:29,560
brain dictating what kind of feature we

1210
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,380
can have the Sun die system is catering

1211
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,750
to everybody's name it's not a small

1212
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:37,150
group of people who determine I guess

1213
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:40,240
develop when and how

1214
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,579
right now we are still at a very early

1215
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:45,309
stage of this open source how our

1216
00:52:45,309 --> 00:52:48,250
movement if we trace back to the lane ID

1217
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:50,290
the open source software test has

1218
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:52,900
started I mean Bill Gates was speaking

1219
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,869
publicly about how open source is

1220
00:52:55,869 --> 00:52:58,599
communism and it won't destroy the

1221
00:52:58,599 --> 00:53:01,540
software industry and hey today

1222
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:03,940
Microsoft is one of the most supportive

1223
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:06,520
of open source and even open up the

1224
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,790
entire Windows 10 if the history of open

1225
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:12,609
source software excuse as a benchmark we

1226
00:53:12,609 --> 00:53:14,050
are pretty much five years away from

1227
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:17,470
this being discussed in mainstream it's

1228
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:19,630
a mindset change but the future is

1229
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:21,839
possible

1230
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,270
and they talk about you know China's

1231
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:27,369
authoritarian there's strong rules and

1232
00:53:27,369 --> 00:53:30,010
all sorts of stuff people here have

1233
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:32,770
developed a way to coexist with the rule

1234
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:35,290
of law and the way life needs to run

1235
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:37,750
this sort of looked the other way at the

1236
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:39,819
right times I think when things need to

1237
00:53:39,819 --> 00:53:41,829
happen this is how we've managed to make

1238
00:53:41,829 --> 00:53:43,089
sure that everyone gets fairly

1239
00:53:43,089 --> 00:53:44,950
compensated everyone's fairly rewarded

1240
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:47,920
and it works through this system there

1241
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,960
another thing to be clear as a thirteen

1242
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,780
doesn't mean evil right it's just that

1243
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:55,210
there is one authority I mean the

1244
00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:57,010
Communist Party knows as well as anyone

1245
00:53:57,010 --> 00:53:58,569
else that they have to keep the people

1246
00:53:58,569 --> 00:53:59,920
happy they're not just going to like

1247
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,660
kick people around because they want to

1248
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:03,609
and they want to be trivial and small

1249
00:54:03,609 --> 00:54:05,950
about it so they try really hard to put

1250
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:07,750
economic policy in place that brings

1251
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:10,119
prosperity one of the things that the

1252
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:12,369
government has said is we need a service

1253
00:54:12,369 --> 00:54:15,460
economy that's tech oriented and we need

1254
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,710
to get more young people interested in

1255
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:19,990
this the maker movement we want to graph

1256
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,569
that into our system and hopefully

1257
00:54:22,569 --> 00:54:25,299
inspire another generation of young

1258
00:54:25,299 --> 00:54:28,569
people to want to become you know

on one hand it's great that the national

1286
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,760
government have seen this emergence of

1287
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:52,390
new media new technology and I think

1288
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,610
it's genuine to want to support it

1289
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:57,160
however I don't think there's a very

1290
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:00,430
good track record so far of governmental

1291
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:03,180
involvement in these more bottom-up

1292
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:06,850
activities we take for example art

1293
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:08,890
districts something that was emerging

1294
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:11,860
out of China 1020 years ago that really

1295
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:14,410
caught the imagination of artists

1296
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:17,200
colonies galleries but as soon as the

1297
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,260
government and started to support it the

1298
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,170
inevitable process of gentrification

1299
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:26,260
happened rent went up more notable

1300
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:29,350
galleries moved in so the artists who

1301
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:32,110
really were trying to experiment had to

1302
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:36,280
move out so I have a concern along

1303
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:40,000
similar lines for these tech sectors the

1304
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,430
government in trying to support it

1305
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:45,550
inevitably will formalize it

1306
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:47,290
[Music]

1307
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:50,180
it's interesting to sort of see the city

1308
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:52,609
evolve and so there's a sort of wave of

1309
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:55,160
money and gentrification you can sort of

1310
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,290
rolling from the you know from the east

1311
00:56:57,290 --> 00:56:58,760
to the west and from the south to the

1312
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,740
north the pace at which they do is just

1313
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:03,020
crazy you can walk from one end of the

1314
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,369
state to the other and by the time you

1315
00:57:04,369 --> 00:57:07,100
walk back the other side enough to say

1316
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,570
will change you you won't recognize it

1317
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:10,280
it's just it's just tearing itself down

1318
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,869
and rebuilding itself as you walk

1319
00:57:11,869 --> 00:57:13,520
through it there's a region over there

1320
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,650
that was all these electronic shops they

1321
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:18,800
just leveled it put up a luxury mall and

1322
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,630
put a high-rise on top of it and you

1323
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:22,430
wouldn't recognize it I mean we have

1324
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:25,490
more high-rise here - anyway in a world

1325
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:27,470
I mean honestly if you walk around

1326
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:29,359
Center right now we have over two

1327
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:31,010
hundred seventy eight buildings being

1328
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:35,210
built up to 74 I travel all over the

1329
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:37,880
world and we look everyone else I hate

1330
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,520
you know we are the fastest growing you

1331
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,020
know society rather industry today

1332
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:44,290
that's just a fact

1333
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:47,869
in China there is a general lack of

1334
00:57:47,869 --> 00:57:51,130
awareness of the negative ramifications

1335
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:55,040
of gentrification just as you know in

1336
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,630
the 60s nowhere New York thought that

1337
00:57:56,630 --> 00:58:00,380
was a bad thing the reason why the city

1338
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:02,390
has embraced this notion new technology

1339
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:04,609
is trying to reinvent itself

1340
00:58:04,609 --> 00:58:07,130
my concern is that industry invention it

1341
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:10,190
wants to very quickly rid of its even

1342
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:12,710
immediate past a city that really

1343
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:15,470
struggled really was dependent on a lot

1344
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:16,670
of things the government couldn't

1345
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:19,510
provide things happen by chance

1346
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:22,430
accidentally a lot of it was bottom-up

1347
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:24,980
in fact there was not one fishing

1348
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:28,420
village there were 2,000

1349
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:32,359
[Music]

1350
00:58:32,359 --> 00:58:34,970
these villages have evolved along with

1351
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:37,970
the city they have taking up very

1352
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:39,999
important roles in providing housing

1353
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:42,739
providing a certain social structure

1354
00:58:42,739 --> 00:58:45,440
jobs a certain stability to the city

1355
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,329
that was not planned

1356
00:58:47,329 --> 00:58:50,390
they simply evolved was the formal city

1357
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:52,910
I would like it more like a you know

1358
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:54,410
sort of the bacterial colony as a petri

1359
00:58:54,410 --> 00:58:56,390
dish eventually you grow a lawn of

1360
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:58,549
bacteria across it you know all the

1361
00:58:58,549 --> 00:59:00,109
communities become interconnected but

1362
00:59:00,109 --> 00:59:01,670
you know that that's sort of a natural

1363
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:03,620
growth curve

1365
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,350
we are in by Sciuto which is one of the

1366

300 more than 300 of em village in

1367
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:23,350
Shenzhen and here like no matter what

1368
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:25,810
you don't need to go anywhere and you

1369
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:28,330
can find everything here that's the

1370
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:30,370
amazing part of this it provides

1371
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:35,440
everything you need for a community when

1372
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,230
the government designated engine as a

1373
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:41,110
special economic zone they left patches

1374
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:43,450
of land for the villagers themselves to

1375
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:47,290
build homes this is a boundary line

1376
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:51,790
between the city and the urban village

1377
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:54,880
this side is open oh man and this is

1378
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:58,390
urban village owned these urban villages

1379
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:01,270
are also breeding ground for a lot of

1380
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:04,840
innovation you can change a structure

1381
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,850
you can change the facade you can spill

1382
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:10,000
your workshop into the alleyways the

1383
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,010
whole neighborhood was built in this

1384
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:17,100
kind of bottom-up way Shenzhen really

1385
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:21,220
represents a new modern image it's a

1386
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:24,070
modern city it's a new city the urban

1387
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:27,700
villages complete opposites to that

1388
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:31,570
image the mayor's office declared the

1389
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:34,870
necessity to rid the cancers of the

1390
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:37,380
society in those words

1391
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:42,660
I should Joe is going to be redevelops

1392
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:47,550
this months actually April 2016 so this

1393
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:51,300
is how fast 150,000 people's who lives

1394
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:55,740
here needs to be relocated this there's

1395
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:57,690
some rumors that like the market here is

1396
01:00:57,690 --> 01:00:58,980
eventually going to have to be displaced

1397
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:01,710
because as as things gentrify the rent

1398
01:01:01,710 --> 01:01:02,910
on the shops are going to go up to the

1399
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:04,470
point where they can't sustain selling

1400
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:06,360
these like small parts and whatnot just

1401
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:07,830
across the street there's much more

1402
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,500
urban village going on that's we're

1403
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,540
headed to and I can't say if it's for

1404
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:14,210
better for worse but it's definitely

1405
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:17,910
things are changing and so you train

1406
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:20,370
this and straight out of like the market

1407
01:01:20,370 --> 01:01:22,320
into you know urban village area like

1408
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:25,530
this personally I have a bias I hope

1409
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:27,390
that it never goes away because I enjoy

1410
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:28,770
it so much and it's such a valuable

1411
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:30,750
resource to me you'll see big districts

1412
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:32,280
where people are taking phones and

1413
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,500
tearing them apart and then another area

1414
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,150
putting them together into another phone

1415
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,910
of sort of recycling and upcycling going

1416
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:41,010
on so you can see like down there

1417
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:43,440
there's a person here with a what looks

1418
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,700
like a pile of trash but if you look

1419
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,530
closely it's just that they're going

1420
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:48,060
through mobile phones and stripping out

1421
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:49,020
parts from them

1422
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:51,450
it's like shucking corn almost

1423
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:53,250
let's take a quick walk through one of

1424
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:56,869
these informal areas

1425
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:02,040
my phone cycle parts he actually has big

1426
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:06,030
bundles of other boards that he's pulled

1427
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:07,079
out of phones that were previously

1428
01:02:07,079 --> 01:02:08,640
thrown away and then what they do is

1429
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,560
they they take out the motherboards and

1430
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,700
they take the chips off and eventually

1431
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:15,510
find their way back down the market you

1432
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:17,460
can get your like roast pigs feet and

1433
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:21,960
then iPhone cases this market itself

1434
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,420
plays a kind of a critical part in the

1435
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:26,609
ecosystem in terms of being able to move

1436
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:28,770
goods around you know if one factory did

1437
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:31,079
a build and they had some excess and

1438
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:32,369
they want to get rid of it a lot of it

1439
01:02:32,369 --> 01:02:34,319
will come through this market and get

1440
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:36,960
recycled through the system this one

1441
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,150
some straight from the factory floor you

1442
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:40,470
can see that the motherboards are even

1443
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:42,869
still in the the carrier so this one was

1444
01:02:42,869 --> 01:02:44,730
one they didn't pass out of Apple fully

1445
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:46,140
fabricated and it found its way into

1446
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:47,579
scrap heap here well people will go

1447
01:02:47,579 --> 01:02:49,020
ahead and they'll you in really see

1448
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:50,520
they've pulled off some ICS

1449
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,800
for recycling and reprocessing into

1450
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:58,490
fixing phone and so forth and here's uh

1451
01:02:58,490 --> 01:03:01,560
these here are blank motherboards and

1452
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:02,819
the interesting your mother's you see

1453
01:03:02,819 --> 01:03:04,319
like no solder on and all they still

1454
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:06,089
have a gold color which means that

1455
01:03:06,089 --> 01:03:07,980
there's been no processing of the board

1456
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:10,500
at all it's straight virgin boards from

1457
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,170
the facility you're gonna move on we're

1458
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:15,770
getting a crowd I can get plenty of

1459
01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:19,250
useful stuff for a fraction of the price

1460
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:21,540
that you would have to even in the

1461
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:24,070
markets you know on the Main Street

1462
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:27,180
that's the stuff that's going away that

1463
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:29,560
those guys will innovate no matter what

1464
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,030
they innovated despite the government

1465
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:32,890
right they'll be they'll be they'll but

1466
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:34,690
they'll keep walking and they may have

1467
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:36,580
cut a path that looked interesting and

1468
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:38,320
that path is now being paved into the

1469
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,330
road they'll cut another path you you

1470
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:42,610
you've never had a fox run over by a

1471
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:44,230
steamroller when they're when they're

1472
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:45,550
putting a road over a forest the Fox

1473
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:47,140
know how to move away right can it can

1474
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:48,580
run and find out that place and as long

1475
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:50,470
as there's continues to be green fields

1476
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:52,360
for these people to go to I think I

1477
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:54,040
think things will be okay and and

1478
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,960
demilitarizing the the Western IP

1479
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:58,000
ecosystem would be great right I think

1480
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,800
that's something we can do right but

1481
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,570
it's just as hard as bringing us back

1482
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:03,670
from the brink of the Cold War everyone

1483
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:06,190
has to sort of ease off universally

1484
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:07,570
agree that we need to have a new

1485
01:04:07,570 --> 01:04:10,420
paradigm and I think one of the problems

1486
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:12,820
in doing that is that the militarization

1487
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:16,750
of IP has really benefited big companies

1488
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:18,910
and if they back off their stance of

1489
01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:22,180
having huge caches of IP to nuke the

1490
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:23,830
little companies that come up they're

1491
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:26,290
threatened by innovation and so instead

1492
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:28,000
of seeing like this openness come out

1493
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,470
you're seeing exactly the opposite

1494
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:31,360
you're seeing the system calcifying and

1495
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:33,460
maybe will happen and is like you know

1496
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:36,280
sure they'll own their edifice but you

1497
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:38,590
know they'll become so entrenched that

1498
01:04:38,590 --> 01:04:40,600
they can't move on right the each of

1499
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,310
them is locked in their space and then a

1500
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:44,680
very flexible ecosystem like China will

1501
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,090
just roll over them later on and they'll

1502
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:47,230
wonder how that happened

1503
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:48,700
it's because they did it to themselves

1504
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:52,169
at the end the day

1505
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,680
the beautifulness of standings who come

1506
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:59,320
here with the talents with your efforts

1507
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:01,840
that your diligence you can earn a place

1508
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:05,140
for yourself that makers the our startup

1509
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:07,960
the Internet of Things producing how're

1510
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:11,140
they all converge here in center and

1511
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,600
that's what makes sense and the second

1512
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,730
body of power not into Putin's to the

1513
01:05:15,730 --> 01:05:19,030
game palette yeah what Shenzhen Santa

1514
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:24,130
kundi and Ania that oxygen food that

1515
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:26,470
harsh with energy free roaming yes in

1516
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:27,160
the tofu

1517
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:29,650
Sandra and Tino Rodriguez in Doha traigo

1518
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:33,190
yo yo yo yo seen the live stream you one

1519
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:36,670
more drive each other oh now you look at

1520
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:40,810
this light switch ad astray every five

1521
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:42,790
star hotel every way in China right now

1522
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:45,820
this is a proper girl identified this is

1523
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:47,980
a perfect sample if we can just have a

1524
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:51,880
person take 2-3 second to just make that

1525
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,470
adjustment

1526
01:05:53,470 --> 01:05:58,360
China will be a perfect place detail are

1527
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,550
they going to be more like the UK in the

1528
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:01,780
sense that they'll just shed the

1529
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:03,190
manufacturing background as they

1530
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:05,740
gentrify and and sort of just go

1531
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:07,900
straight for like you know a service

1532
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:10,600
economy or will they keep rooted in a

1533
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,430
sort of a manufacturing ecosystem and

1534
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:15,010
keep designed parallel to it or will

1535
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:16,780
they just forever stay in manufacturing

1536
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:18,490
right is that really just their their

1537
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:20,410
core base and value and wit and where

1538
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:21,190
they want to be

1539
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:23,320
I mean if China went from where they

1540
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,540
were to where they are today in 30 years

1541
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:27,310
they could do that again 30 years ago

1542
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:28,630
thin my life that we could see the

1543
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:31,960
incidence question it'll be interesting

1544
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:36,000
to see where the answer ends up
